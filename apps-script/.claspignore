# This file tells clasp which files and directories to ignore when pushing.
# It works just like a .gitignore file.

# 1. Ignore the template file, as only the generated Sidebar.html should be pushed.
Sidebar.template.html

# 2. Explicitly UN-ignore the generated Sidebar.html file.
# This ensures it gets pushed even though it's in the main .gitignore file.
!Sidebar.html
